EMMO use case for horizontal interoperability
=============================================
Horizontal interoperability is about interoperability between
different types of models and codes for a single material (i.e. one
use case, multiple models).


The key here is to show how to map between EMMO (or an EMMO-based
ontology) and another ontology (possible EMMO-based).  In this example
we use a data-driven approach.


Requirements
------------
In addition to emmo, this demo also requires:
  - [dlite][1], for handling metadata and mapping
  - [ASE][2], for reading atom structure from cif and visualisation
