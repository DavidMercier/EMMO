EMMO use case for vertical interoperability
===========================================
Vertical interoperability is about interoperability across two or more
granulaty levels.

In this use case we study the welded interface between an aluminium
and a steel plate at three granularity levels.  In this case, the
granularity levels corresponds to three different length scales, that
we here denote _macroscopic_, _microscopic_ and _atomistic_.
