European Materials and Modelling Ontology (EMMO)
================================================
EMMO is a multidisciplinary effort to develop a standard
representational framework (the ontology) based on current materials
modelling knowledge, including physical sciences, analytical
philosophy and information and communication technologies.  This
multidisciplinarity is illustrated by the figure on the title page.
It provides the connection between the physical world, materials
characterisation world and materials modelling world.

EMMO is released under a [Creative Commons license](emmo/LICENSE.md).
The accompinied Python API is released under the [BSD
